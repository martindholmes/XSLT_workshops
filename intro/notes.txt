TTD list:

Syd: search for snippet-task.xml on laptop; if not there, try to
remember what's supposed to be in it. ANSWER: it is in the package/
directory. (And has been there since 10-27, no idea why we didn't see
it last week.)

Syd: make slideset (intro/summary) for hamlet_basic.xsl walkthrough.

#Martin: Find and test desktop recording software. DONE: KAZAM looks good, and vokoscreen is even better. You need good USB audio for the microphone; when I tried with an analog mic I got horrible results with both pieces of software. next question: what to use for post-processing?

Martin: Check video alignment with slides.

Notes for first basic XSLT task:

1. We present the _basic.xslt file piece by piece and they follow along.

2. We assign as a task the addition of handlers for front, castList and castItem; we instruct them to suppress castGroup for the moment.

3. Supplementary assignment: handle castGroup.
