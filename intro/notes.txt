TTD list:

Syd: search for snippet-task.xml on laptop; if not there, try to remember what's supposed to be in it.

Syd: make slideset (intro/summary) for hamlet_basic.xsl walkthrough.

Martin: Find and test desktop recording software. 

Martin: Check video alignment with slides.

Notes for first basic XSLT task:

1. We present the _basic.xslt file piece by piece and they follow along.

2. We assign as a task the addition of handlers for front, castList and castItem; we instruct them to suppress castGroup for the moment.

3. Supplementary assignment: handle castGroup.
