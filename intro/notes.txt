TTD list:

In Slideset #7, Slide #7: The task (#2) requires things that we haven't yet taught (either xsl:if or not()). We need to teach those two concepts at that point, using different examples, then assign the task; finally, a walkthrough video showing how it's actually done will help.

Following on from Slideset #7: The students have been asked to list some things they didn't know how to do; we could provide our own list, and then work through demos and assignments based on that list. We should both start making that list here in the notes file.
