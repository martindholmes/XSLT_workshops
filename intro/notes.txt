TTD list:

Syd: search for snippet-task.xml on laptop; if not there, try to
remember what's supposed to be in it. ANSWER: it is in the package/
directory. (And has been there since 10-27, no idea why we didn't see
it last week.)

#Syd: make slideset (intro/summary) for hamlet_basic.xsl walkthrough.

Martin: Use Vokoscreen to create the first screencast walking through the hamlet_basic.xsl.

Syd: Try this too if it can work on 12.04.

Martin: Identify a usable Linux video editor.

Martin: Check video alignment with slides.

Notes for first basic XSLT task:

1. We present the _basic.xslt file piece by piece and they follow along.

2. We assign as a task the addition of handlers for front, castList and castItem; we instruct them to suppress castGroup for the moment.

3. Supplementary assignment: handle castGroup.
